# CE888_ASSIGNEMENT_2
Complete project codes

1. All the refernces for the algorithms and codes are added as comments in the code. aif360 is the only toolbox used for detection and mitigation.

2. The source of the data is cited in the report, however I have uploaded the data here as well for convenience.

3. The notebook named 'CE888_BIAS_SEX' contains the complete pipeline code from detection to classification with protected attribute 'sex'

4. The notebook named 'CE888_BIAS_RACE' contain the complete pipeline code from detection to classification with protected attribute 'race'.    

5. Note :
    The pre-processing functions are the same for both the attributes. However, specify the attriute in the 'load_prepoc_data' function. You can choose any variable as the protected attribute, however keep in mind that it should fit the definitions of bias in the project.
